# StickyHeaderPhoneBookLikeLolipopAndroid
This is a simple phone book with sticky header. Like this:

<br><br>
Here I have included a Fragment that loades the contacts view LoaderManager and shows them in RecyclerView.<br><br>
You can just open the fragment in your container to get the phone book in your app.<br><br>
This project does not handles other options like call on click, or click effect. I tried to keep it pretty simple so that one can understands how the sticky header works. You can use it and implement the functionality you need on top of this.<br><br><br>
Thank you
